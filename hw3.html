            <div class="concept-title">Mean (Media)</div>
            <p>
                The mean is a measure of central tendency, representing the average value in a dataset.
            </p>
            <p>Formula:<br>
                Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)<br>
            </p>
            <p>Process:<br>
                Sum up all the data points and divide the total by the number of data points.<br>
                For example, if we have the numbers 2, 4, and 6, the mean is (2 + 4 + 6) / 3 = 4.<br>

        <div class="concept-panel">
            <div class="concept-title">Variance (Varianza)</div>
            <p>
                Variance measures how much the data points in a dataset differ from the mean. It shows the spread of the data.
            </p>
            <p>Formula:<br>
                Variance = (Sum of squared differences from the mean) / (Number of values)<br>
            </p>
            <p>Process:<br>
                First, find the mean. Then, subtract the mean from each data point, square the result, and sum them up. Divide by the number of data points.<br>
                A higher variance indicates greater spread among the values.<br>

            <div class="concept-title">Standard Deviation (Deviazione Standard)</div>
            <p>
                The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the dispersion of the data relative to the mean.
            </p>
            <p>Formula:<br>
                Standard Deviation = √Variance<br>
            </p>
            <p>Process:<br>
                Calculate the variance first, then take the square root of the result.<br>
                Standard deviation gives a more interpretable measure of spread compared to variance, as it is in the same units as the data.<br>

            <p>
                An empirical distribution represents the observed frequencies of data points, giving an approximation of the probability distribution based on the sample.
            </p>
            <p>Process:<br>
                Collect the observed data points, group them into bins, and calculate the frequency of each bin.<br>
                The empirical distribution is often represented as a histogram.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Usage:<br>
                Empirical distributions help understand the actual spread and pattern of the data in a sample.<br>

            <div class="concept-title">Central Limit Theorem (Teorema del Limite Centrale)</div>
            <p>
                The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the original data distribution.
            </p>
            <p>Process:<br>
                Take random samples from a population and calculate their means.<br>
                As the number of samples increases, the distribution of these means will approach a normal distribution.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Usage:<br>
                This theorem is fundamental in inferential statistics, allowing us to make predictions about population parameters from sample statistics.<br>

                The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.
            </p>
            <p>Formula:<br>
                P(X=k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)<br>
                where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, and p is the probability of success.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Process:<br>
                Use the formula to calculate the probability of obtaining exactly k successes in n trials.<br>
                Binomial distributions are used when there are only two outcomes (e.g., success or failure).<br>

            <p>
                The arithmetic mean is the most common measure of central tendency, representing the average of all values in a dataset.

            <p>Formula:<br>
                Arithmetic Mean = (Σxᵢ) / N<br>

            <p>Process:<br>
                1. Add up all the values in the dataset.<br>
                2. Divide the sum by the number of values (N).<br>

            </p>
            <p>Process:<br>
                1. Count how often each value appears in the dataset.<br>
                2. The value with the highest frequency is the mode.<br>
                If multiple values have the same frequency, the dataset is multimodal, and all such values are considered modes.<br>

                The geometric mean is a measure of central tendency that is calculated as the nth root of the product of all values. It is useful for datasets involving growth rates or ratios.
            </p>
            <p>Formula:<br>
                Geometric Mean (GM) = (Πxᵢ)^(1/N)<br>

            </p>
            <p>Process:<br>
                1. Multiply all the values in the dataset together.<br>
                2. Take the Nth root of the product, where N is the number of values.<br>
                The geometric mean is particularly effective for datasets where values vary multiplicatively, such as financial returns.<br>

                The harmonic mean is a measure of central tendency, particularly useful for rates. It is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the values.
            </p>
            <p>Formula:<br>
                Harmonic Mean (HM) = N / Σ(1/xᵢ)<br>
                Where Σ(1/xᵢ) is the sum of the reciprocals of all values, and N is the total number of values.<br>

            <p>Process:<br>
                1. Find the reciprocal of each value in the dataset.<br>
                2. Calculate the sum of these reciprocals.<br>
                3. Divide the number of values (N) by this sum.<br>

            <p>Formula:<br>
                Midrange = (min + max) / 2<br>

                1. A random number r is generated between 0 and 1.<br>
